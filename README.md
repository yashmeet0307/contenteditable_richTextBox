# contenteditable_richTextBox
rich-text-box with smileys and keyboard shortcuts

emojiarea.js allows you to build a rich-text-box that can receive user input and provide configurable emoji in response to tokens and also have configurable keyboard shortcuts.

As an example, if I were to type ‘:)’ into the textbox, it would be replaced with a smiling emoji. If I were to type ‘:D’, it would be replaced with a laughing emoji in the same place.

As an example for keyboard shortcuts, if I were to type ‘Cmd a’ or ‘Cmd n’, the size of the emoji and text in the entire textbox would be increased or decreased.

To add more emoji all you have to do is add the a symobl and corresponding image in config.js
